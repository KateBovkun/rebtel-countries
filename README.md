## Country game

I've decide to make test into a game. 
Initial screen has only one button that will open random country. 
You can navigate to it's naibour country by tapping to a cell in a table view under borders section.

Try to get to your home country that way (or any other of your choice), it's fun!

## Comments
  - In real world I refrain from using storyboard and would do dependency injection from App/SceneDelegate
  - Would add coordinator to control navigation and would not use segues.
  - Tests was used here for debug perposes, would prefer to write more tests but haven't had time for it
